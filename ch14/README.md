# Here There Be Dragons: Reflect, Unsafe, and Cgo

## Reflection Lets Us Work with Types at Runtime

Reflection provides the ability to examine, modify, and create variables, 
functions, and structs at runtime.

### Types, Kinds, and Values

### Making New Values

## Use Reflection to Write a Data Marshaller

## Build Functions with Reflection to Automate Repetitive Tasks

## You Can Build Structs with Reflection, but Don't

## Reflection Can't Make Methods

## Only Use Reflection If It's Worthwhile

## `unsafe` Is Unsafe

### Use `unsafe` to Convert External Binary Data

## Cgo Is for Integration, Not Performance
